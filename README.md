# Rationale
I recently discovered a fabulous website, https://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com that tells you if the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) has destroyed the world yet. Convinced that such useful information should be more easily available to the public, I decided to rescue humanity by building this salutary application.

# Concept
Wise humans using this application can check in realtime the status of Earth by taking a glance at their status bar. There, they shall find recomfort or horror, depending on the icon's color:
    Icon is red;
    You are "dans les choux",
    Icon is blue;
    Rejoyce and go ahead!

 # Credits
 Last, I address my most sincere congratulations and thank to the creator and maintainer of HTLHCDTWY.com, for all his hard work and dedication towards the human race. Furthermore, I am obliged to GH user [JaredCubilla](https://github.com/JaredCubilla/has-the-large-hadron-collider-destroyed-the-world-yet) for the original idea.
