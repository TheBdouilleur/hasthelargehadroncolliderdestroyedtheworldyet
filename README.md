# Rationale
I recently discovered a fabulous website, https://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com that tells you if the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) has destroyed the world yet. Convinced that such useful information should be more easily available to the public, I decided to rescue humanity by building this salutary application.

# Principle
Wise humans using this application can check in realtime the status of Earth by taking a glance at their status bar. There, they shall find recomfort or horror, depending on the icon's color:
    Icon is red;
    You are "dans les choux",
    Icon is blue;
    Rejoyce and go ahead!
